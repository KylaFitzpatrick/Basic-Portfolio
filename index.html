      <p>My name is Kyla Fitzpatrick. I was born in San Francisco, CA on March 26, 1991.
        I grew up in a small little town called Mill Valley located north of San Francisco.
        I lived in Mill Valley until I started college at Sonoma State Univeristy.
        I decided I wasnted to explore the world outside of California and decided to
        live with my grandpa in Northern Virgina. I attended community college there for about a year.
        Then I transferred to University of North Carolina at Carlotte. During my time there I studied
        abroad in Barcelona and decided to major in International Business.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Sortly after graduating I landed an internship as a release cordinator at a hedge fund company.
        After my internship ended I was hired back as a junior QA Analyst. Since then I moved to the Bay Area then lived
        in Austin, Texas for 3 years before deciding to join The Boot Camp at UT Austin. My hobbies include spending
        time
        with family and friends. I enjoy traveling, camping and listening to all kinds of music, but my favorite genre
        is
        indie. I love attending concerts and festivals especially Austin City Limits.
